# Setup

Before you start you need to create a keys.json file in this folder with content like this

```json
{
    "client_id": "client_id_provided_by_plandisc",
    "client_secret": "client_secret_provided_by_plandisc"
}
```

# Run locally

When you've created the keys.json you can run the application using "npm start"
